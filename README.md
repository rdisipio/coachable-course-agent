# Coachable Course Agent

An AI-powered, feedback-aware course recommendation system designed for human-AI interaction in HR tech.  
This agent doesn't just rank courses ‚Äî it walks alongside the user, learning from feedback and helping shape a career path.

---

This project started as a clever demo. It has since grown into something more fundamental: a principled foundation for human-AI interaction in learning and career growth.

The goal is simple but ambitious:  
**Align what's technically possible with what is humanly meaningful.**

Guided by the [Google People + AI Guidebook](https://pair.withgoogle.com/guidebook/) and best practices from UX research, the agent is designed not just to recommend courses, but to *listen, adapt, and explain itself*. Every recommendation is transparent, every piece of feedback shapes the next interaction, and every design choice centers on trust and user agency.

This repo is intentionally unfinished in places. It leaves space for collaboration, critique, and refinement ‚Äî because building human-centered AI is not a solo act.

I believe that a project like this can make a difference in the world: helping people see their skills, grow their potential, and find paths they might not have imagined. As Muse once sang, let's 

üéµ *"conspire to ignite all the souls that would die just to feel alive."* üéµ
