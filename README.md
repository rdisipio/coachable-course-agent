# Coachable Course Agent

*A human-AI course recommendation agent that listens, learns, and adapts.*

---

## 🧠 What It Is

**Coachable Course Agent** is an interactive learning assistant built with [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) and powered by [Groq](https://groq.com/), designed to recommend upskilling courses based on structured feedback, memory, and ESCO skill taxonomy.

Unlike traditional recommenders that track clicks and ratings, this agent asks—and remembers—*why* a course did or didn’t work for you.
